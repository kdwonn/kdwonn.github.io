I am a Ph.D student at POSTECH Computer Vision Lab., supervided by Prof. Suha Kwak.
I completed my B.S. in computer science and engineering also at POSTECH.

My research interest lies in multi-modal learning and representation learning.
Specifically, I recently work on the structured representation that can resolve the ambiguity of the multi-modal data. 

I am looking for the oppertunities of interesting collaborations and internship! 
If you are interested in my works or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

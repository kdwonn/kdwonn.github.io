I am a Ph.D. student at POSTECH Computer Vision Lab, supervised by Prof. Suha Kwak.
My research centers on whether machines can learn representations with the right abstraction and hierarchy, spanning work in compositional representation ([SelfMod](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/bbf9c6e203e2638d756929c1e5bbe85e-Abstract-Conference.html)), multi-modalities ([DivE](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kim_Improving_Cross-Modal_Retrieval_With_Set_of_Diverse_Embeddings_CVPR_2023_paper.html), [SaG](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kim_Shatter_and_Gather_Learning_Referring_Image_Segmentation_with_Text_Supervision_ICCV_2023_paper.html), [MaskGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07730)), and model-based RL (WIP).
